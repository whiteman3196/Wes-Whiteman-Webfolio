  <p>A financial downturn disrupted functioning capital markets. Several investment segments needed cash and borrowed, while other segments searched for investment products. Three key lines needed attention. The segmentation plan filed with New York State prohibited investment segments from long-term borrowing and / or investing with each other.
		</p>
	<p>Evaluated the situation to define the most appropriate approach to meet cash demands. Assessed multiple investment segments aggregating those to combine into a single investment segment. Through the merger, created an investment segment with diversified liability sources that spanned different economic environments and created an aggregate liability structure that spanned the maturity spectrum.
		</p>
	<p>This work ensured optimum performance of $25 billion across the three product lines.
