  <p>Sought maximum liquidity at the holding company level during a financial downturn.
While the operating company possessed the ability to leverage investments to create liquidity, no way existed to transfer that liquidity to the holding company.
		</p>
	<p>Spearheaded an effort to extra-contractually pre-pay existing obligations between the operating company and the holding company with proceeds from FHLB borrowing. This effectively replaced one liability with a similar liability at the operating company while generating liquidity at the holding company.
		</p>
	<p>Leading this effort required persistence and coordination across the enterprise that eventually produced $1 billion of liquidity at the holding company level.
