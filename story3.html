  <p>Traditional product offerings generally targeted the defined contribution market. The PRICOA Global Funding I technology allowed access to qualified institutional buyers, but not to the broader market. Group insurance product set did not offer retail focused investments.
		</p>
	<p>Combining the existing group insurance structure with the technology to transform the insurance offering into a security. Replaced the business trust used in the institutional notes program with the holding company. With the holding company as an SEC registrant, this allowed an effective transition into the retail space.
		</p>
	<p>Launched a retail notes program that delivered $3.5 billion of sales while helping retail investors meet fixed income needs. Encouraged team creativity and negotiated successfully with internal and external stakeholders.
